Problem Set 2: Custom Modifications Using ALTER Command

1. Add a New Column to Each Table:
   - In Players add `total_score` to represent a playerâ€™s score.
   - In Games, add `rating` to represent the players rating.


ALTER TABLE Jm_player
ADD total_score INT DEFAULT 0;

ALTER TABLE Mj_Games
ADD rating DECIMAL(2, 1);


2. Apply a Unique Constraint:
   
 ALTER TABLE Jm_player
ADD CONSTRAINT unique_username UNIQUE (user_name);

 ALTER TABLE Mj_Games
ADD CONSTRAINT check_rating_range CHECK (rating BETWEEN 1 AND 5);


3. Reflection:
 The unique constraint on `rank` ensures that each player has a distinct position, maintaining a reliable ranking system. This adds depth to the data, helping to track and organize player standings effectively
