 My Portfolio

The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate my experience with PL/SQL, which is a programming language created for Oracle databases.

As I embark on learning PL/SQL, I want to start with the following fundamentals â€“ writing code blocks, variable declaration, and exception handling. I understand that it may not be a walk in the park because there are several obstacles I have to overcome. The classes of Sir Glenn, however, who is an expert in computers, will make me master the topic with ease.

In order to facilitate working with PL/SQL, I shall try to understand its fundamentals and explore how it can be applied further, I think that would make me cope with this lesson better.
