Problem Set 4: Batch Deletes and Cascade Constraints

1. Delete Records Based on a Condition
In this step, youâ€™ll delete records of players who are younger than a certain age (e.g., 18 years) from the Jm_Player table.

DELETE FROM Jm_Player WHERE age < 18;


This command removes all records of players under 18 from the Jm_Player table. You can adjust the age condition based on your needs.

   
2. Drop a Table with Cascade Constraints:
To achieve this, you use the CASCADE CONSTRAINTS clause when dropping the Jm_Player

DROP TABLE Jm_Player CASCADE CONSTRAINTS; 


3. Reflection:
   CASCADE CONSTRAINTS ensure that when a record in Players is deleted, related records in Games are automatically removed. This prevents orphaned data and keeps the database organized by enforcing that every game must have a valid player reference.
